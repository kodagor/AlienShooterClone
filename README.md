# AlienShooterClone
I've always wanted to create an Alien Shooter Clone. So this is my project I was working on in free time.

Python version: 3.6.4<br>Pygame version: 1.9.2

</ul>

<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>
   to start game: click on the "PLAY" button<br>
   move left: LEFT_ARROW or A<br>
   move right: RIGHT_ARROW or D<br>
   shoot: SPACEBAR<br>
   quit: ESC<br>
</p>
<p>
   Main target is to destroy entire alien's fleet. After that, player jumps to the next lvl, but game becomes harder. When player dies, highscore is saved until game is running.
